Sicilian dragon has certainly been refreshing, but Caballo Cinema have almost completely replaced high-level strategic showcases
which felt we couldn't leave out, and decided to do something about it.</p>
</article>

<p>
The sicilian dragon movie shows a journey a chess grandmaster has done to know all necessary basic principles behind the sicilian
defence. The movie teaches the youth to make right decisions in life and how to defend themselves in series cases which usually 
involves being faced with hard challenges at once.</p>
</article>

<p>
It shows that as a young student, and trying to be upcoming, in Chess you dont have to memorize or remember everything in an opening
inorder to use it, but it simply shows that you have to be creative and understand the main lines. This applies to real life situations 
whereby even if you dont become a professional chess player, this game will still help you make the right moves in life, and to notice
your own mistakes and accept them.
</p>

<p>
Sicilian dragon its our conviction that the youth will eventually be more succesful playing the main lines, simply because they are based
on better moves, and also teaches the youth not to be scared of losing as it helps you learn from your mistakes.
</p>

<p>
We are excited about this series and hope that the viewers will share some of that excitement.
